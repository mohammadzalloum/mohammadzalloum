## 🧠 How It Works

1. Sensors continuously monitor for fire or gas.
2. When detected, the robot can:
   - Trigger alerts via app
   - Move towards the source
   - Use air pump to assist in extinguishing
   - Operate robotic arm for custom actions
3. All operations can be controlled manually via mobile app.

## 📱 Mobile App

The robot is fully controllable from a mobile application. The app allows:

- Real-time movement control
- Sensor data display
- Notifications when fire or gas is detected
- Manual activation of arm and air pump
